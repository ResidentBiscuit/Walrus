# Contributing to Walrus IRC
Your help is always welcome! The project is currently very young, so the code base is subject to abrupt and significant changes, though it *should* be fairly stable now.

If you want to submit an enhancement or fix an issue, just fork, do you work on development, and submit a PR.
